# 2020 Advent of Code

https://adventofcode.com/2020/

For fun, I'm trying to complete the Advent of Code challenges using a different programming language each day!

This is a speed contest (and this is all trash anyway) so don't judge my code quality :)
I've never touched about half of these languages before.

## Completed days

- [Day 1: Ruby](1/1.rb)
- [Day 2: Lua](2/2.lua)
- [Day 3: Cobol!](3/3.cbl)
- [Day 4: Swift](4/4.swift)
- [Day 5: Bash](5/5.sh)
- [Day 6: C (99)](6/6.c)
- [Day 7: AWK](7/7.awk)

## Silly superlatives

- __Most fun:__ Cobol! Bad documentation, but a very interesting and different experience. I'm looking forward to Fortran.
- __Easiest day:__ Day 5! `tr`, `sort`, `head`, `tail`, `seq`, `comm`, and one single for loop. Fastest solution by far.
- __Most frustrating:__ Swift... I felt like every example and StackOverflow post referenced an old version of Swift and no longer worked. I had no idea it was already at version 5!
