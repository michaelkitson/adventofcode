# 2020 Advent of Code

https://adventofcode.com/2020/

For fun, I'm trying to complete the Advent of Code challenges using a different programming language each day!

This is a speed contest (and this is all trash anyway) so don't judge my code quality :)
I've never touched about half of these languages before.

## Completed days

- [Day 1: Ruby](1/1.rb)
  Oh ruby, having [Array#combination](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.2/Array.html#method-i-combination) felt like cheating.
- [Day 2: Lua](2/2.lua)
- [Day 3: Cobol!](3/3.cbl)
  Bad documentation, but a very interesting and different experience. I'm looking forward to Fortran.
- [Day 4: Swift](4/4.swift)
  Ugh. I felt like every example and StackOverflow post referenced an old version of Swift and no longer worked. I had no idea it was already at version 5!
- [Day 5: Bash](5/5.sh)
  `tr`, `sort`, `head`, `tail`, `seq`, `comm`, and one single for loop. Fastest solution by far.
- [Day 6: C (99)](6/6.c)
- [Day 7: AWK](7/7.awk)
  Not the best problem to have chosen awk for...
- [Day 8: Crystal](8/8.cr)
  Fun! I've toyed with writing simple interpreters before, so this was a nice throwback.
- [Day 9: Tcl](9/9.tcl)
  Intimidating looking, but very well explained in the [wiki](https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/page/Tcl+Tutorial+Lesson+0). Once I got moving, Tcl wasn't bad.
- [Day 10: Java](10/Ten.java)
  I haven't used Java in a long while. Still not a fan...
- [Day 11: PHP](11/11.php)
  Building a cellular automaton. This felt like an interview question with an optimal solution I didn't know ðŸ˜‚.
- [Day 12: Nim](12/twelve.nim)
  Surprisingly intuitive language, pretty fun!
- [Day 13: Fortran](13/13.f90)
  A thousand segfaults later, I finally solved it. What a pain. I should have used Fortran on an easier, earlier problem.
- [Day 14: C++](14/14.cpp)
  Its been a while since I've written any C++, but the day of Fortran made it feel like heaven.
- [Day 15: CoffeeScript](15/15.coffee)
  A little terser than normal JS, and totally adequate, but I'm not surprised people started giving up on CoffeeScript a few years ago.
- [Day 16: Kotlin](16/16.kt)
  Before this, I was skeptical of Kotlin, but I loved it! It was a total joy to use. Unfortunately, I got hung up on a silly off-by one error where I read one less input line than I needed and was stuck for a loooong time.
